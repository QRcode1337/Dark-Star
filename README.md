QHTC
QHTC is a model that describes the basis for consciousness, explains how living organisms know and use information, and how the role of information in nature maintains the same fundamental status as that of matter and energy. More specifically, the QHTC considers consciousness an essential component of the universe, and that all matter possesses subjective characteristics of consciousness (i.e., the foundation of everything). The QHTC, which considers consciousness as non-local in the same way that quantum objects behave in a non-local manner, has potential significant implications for understanding anomalous events associated with the “contact modalities”. In fact, physicist Claude Swanson’s proposed Synchronized Universe Model (S.U.M) attempts to explain how contact modalities are interrelated under ZPE quantum fields which serve as the foundation for human consciousness. Collectively, the S.U.M and QHTC have the potential to help explain many of the phenomena traditionally associated with NHI based experiences that are inconsistent with traditional scientific principles (consciousness and the nature of reality).

(ASIC)
Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), rather than a general-purpose CPU. They are hardwired to implement a limited class of quantum algorithms. More advanced quantum devices can be programmed to run simple quantum circuits, which makes them more similar to Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), integrated circuits that are programmed using a low-level, hardware-specific Hardware Description Language. In both cases, an intimate knowledge of the hardware design and limitations is needed to run effective algorithms.

(CVD)
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and directional polishing to control how the NVs form in the lattice. For their diamond substrate, which has a commonly aligned surface, where the lattice is oriented along the same crystollagraphic plane (called 111 in this case), Ishiwata and his colleagues achieved ensembles of NVs all with the same orientation. For a substrate measuring about 10 microns across, just less than the width of a human hair, their method can produce somewhere around 10,000 such centers within 10 nanometers from surface.

NVs
Same respective locations of their crystal units and so close to the surface, the group could conduct nanoscale NMR detection of the fluorine in oil making contact with the substrate. The reliability of their fabrication method has (literally) far reaching applications for wide field measurements, ensuring the high contrast detection over relatively large sample areas.

(111)
Perfectly aligned, high-density, shallow nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers on the (111) surface of a diamond. The study involved step-flow growth with a high flux of nitrogen during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth, which resulted in the formation of a highly concentrated (>1019 cm−3) nitrogen layer approximately 10 nm away from the substrate surface. Photon counts obtained from the NV centers indicated the presence of 6.1 × 1015–3.1 × 1016 cm−3 NV centers, which suggested the formation of an ensemble of NV centers. The optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectrum confirmed perfect alignment (more than 99%) for all the samples fabricated by step-flow growth via CVD. Perfectly aligned shallow ensemble NV centers indicated a high Rabi contrast of approximately 30% which is comparable to the values reported for a single NV center. Nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance demonstrated surface-sensitive nuclear spin detection and provided a confirmation of the NV centers' depth. Single NV center approximation indicated that the depth of the NV centers was approximately 9–10.7 nm from the surface with error of less than ±0.8 nm. Thus, a route for material control of shallow NV centers has been developed by step-flow growth using a CVD system. Our finding pioneers on the atomic level control of NV center alignment for large area quantum magnetometry.

Quantum Chess
Quantum Chess, a variant of the chess game invented by Selim Akl, uses the weird properties of quantum physics. Unlike the chess pieces of the conventional game, where a pawn is a pawn, and a rook is a rook, a quantum chess piece is a superposition of "states", each state representing a different conventional piece. In Quantum Chess, a player does not know the identity of a piece (that is, whether it is a pawn, a rook, a bishop, and so on) until the piece is selected for a move. Once a piece is selected it elects to behave as one of its constituent conventional pieces, but soon recovers its quantum state and returns to being a superposition of two or more pieces. Conventional chess is a game of complete information, and thanks to their raw power and clever algorithms, computers reign supreme when pitted against human players. The idea behind Quantum Chess is to introduce an element of unpredictability into chess, and thereby place the computer and the human on a more equal footing. Because a true quantum board may be a few years in the future, for her summer project, Alice Wismath, an undergraduate in the School of Computing, and a summer NSERC student working with Dr. Akl, created a program to model one variation of Quantum Chess, as well as a computer strategy to play the game.

Imperative Quantum Programming Languages
Quantum imperative language (QIL), to analyse quantum entanglement. As mentioned in a previous section, analysis of quantum entanglement. The earliest proposed quantum programming languages followed the imperative programming paradigm. This line of languages was started by Knill , who gave a set of conventions for writing quantum algorithms in pseudo-code. While Knill’s proposal was not very formal, it was very influential in the design of later imperative quantum programming languages. More complete imperative languages were defined by Omer , Sanders and Zuliani , and Bettelliet al. A common feature of these imperative quantum programming languages is that a program is viewed as a sequence of operations which operate by updating some global state. These languages can be directly compiled onto or interpreted in the QRAM virtual hardware model. Quantum states in this paradigm are typically realized as arrays of qubits, and run-time checks are needed to detect certain error conditions. For instance, out-of-bounds checks are necessary for array accesses, and distinctness checks must be used to ensure i = j when applying a binary quantum operation to two qubits i and j. As is typical for imperative programming languages, the type system of these languages is not rich enough to allow all such checks to be performed at compile-time. Also,typically these languages do not have a formal semantics, with the exception of Sanders and Zuliani’s language, which possesses an operational semantics.The various languages in this category each offer a set of advanced programming features. For instance, ¨Omer’s language QCL contains such features as, automatic scratch space management, and a rich language for describing user-defined operators. It also offers some higher-order operations such as computing the inverse of a user-defined operator. The language of Bettelli et al. emphasizes practicality. It is conceived as an extension of C++, and it treats quantum operators as first-class objects which can be explicitly constructed and manipulated at run-time. One of the most powerful features of this language is the on-the-fly optimization of quantum operators, which is performed at run-time.Finally, Sanders and Zuliani’s language qGCL is of a somewhat different flavor. Based on Dijkstra’s guarded command language, qGCL is as much a specification language as a programming language, and it supports a mechanism of step wise refinement which can be used to systematically derive and verify programs.

Quantum Magnetic Resonance Analyzer
It works on the principle of quantum medicine, it collects the weak magnetic field of human cells and then analyze them and determine a person's health status and problems, putting them forward with standard prevention recommendations. Quantum Resistance theory is similar with that of radio as there are wireless waves in air, but if you want to listen to a specific broadcasting station then you need to modulate the radio to same frequency which is causing the resonance and then only radio can get the specific broadcasting channel. Quantum Resistance works on the same principle.The person just has to hold the sensor with a straight arm and then in under two minutes the machine will collect the magnetic field and thus transferring it to a program which is compatible with Windows and then generating a 41 test report. It's fast and not invasive.

Imaginary time
Although rather difficult to visualize, imaginary time is not imaginary in the sense of being unreal or made-up. Rather, it bears a similar relationship to normal physical time as the imaginary number scale does to the real numbers in the complex plane, and can perhaps best be portrayed as an axis running perpendicular to that of regular time. It provides a way of looking at the time dimension as if it were a dimension of space, so that it is possible to move forwards and backwards along it, just as one can move right and left or up and down in space. Despite its rather abstract and counter-intuitive nature, the usefulness of imaginary time arises in its ability to help mathematically to smooth out gravitational singularities in models of the universe. Normally, singularities (like those at the centre of black holes, or the Big Bang itself) pose a problem for physicists, because they are areas where the known physical laws just do not apply. When visualized in imaginary time, however, the singularity is removed and the Big Bang functions like any other point in space-time. Exactly what such a concept might represent in the real world, though, is unknown, and currently it remains little more than a potentially useful theoretical construct.

Quantum levitation
Quantum levitation as it is called is a process where scientists use the properties of quantum physics to levitate an object (specifically, a superconductor) over a magnetic source (specifically a quantum levitation track designed for this purpose).

Hundredth monkey effect
The hundredth monkey effect is a hypothetical phenomenon in which a new behavior or idea is claimed to spread rapidly by unexplained means from one group to all related groups once a critical number of members of one group exhibit the new behavior or acknowledge the new idea like Q.

Psychotropic Pills
Medications weaken the nervous system and cause brain damage as well as being addictive and toxic. Most importantly these illnesses are nothing but labels for human emotional states and imbalances which have spawned a multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical/medical industrial complex.There is no scientific evidence that any of these illnesses are caused by chemical imbalance as they are all just a hypothesis. Techniques to help children and adults wean off their psychotropic medications in conjunction with their prescribing physician, to then address the individual symptoms, identifying them and then eradicating their underlying causes. We just say nutrition basically is the lack of things and the cause for most mental problems.*

Quantum Play*
The quantum "play" would be like a divine help in our DNA because obviously it had help early off reaching where we are today. Lets think evolution is like a chess game It would take 100 times longer to reach our DNA advanced structure without any assistance and its very well far beyond random. Spirits and god could interact with the pieces as this would be light encoded and embedded and modified. These would be small improvements over time with male DNA chromosomes fixing the female DNA chromosomes. So it's like winning a game as it would take anything else in the universe without a god 100 times as long to reach our levels of complexity in the genomes.

Quantum-FEED*
100 trillion cells means every second you are regenerating 1 million cells - so the real question is what are you feeding your quantum body daily exactly?
Q = E E E (XY+XY/ZZ-$)
